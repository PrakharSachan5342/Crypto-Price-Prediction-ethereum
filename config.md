To run this code, follow these steps:
Ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed. You can use pip to install the required packages: pip install pandas scikit-learn matplotlib.
Prepare your cryptocurrency price dataset in CSV format. Replace 'cryptocurrency_prices.csv' in the code with the path or filename of your dataset.
Adjust the code to preprocess your data, selecting relevant features, and preparing the target variable (X and y).
Run the code in a Python environment (e.g., Jupyter Notebook, Python IDE, or terminal). Make sure the dataset file is in the same directory as the code or provide the correct path to the file.
After executing the code, it will print the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) as evaluation metrics for the model's performance.
Additionally, a plot will be displayed showing the actual prices and predicted prices for the test set.
